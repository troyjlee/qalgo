### Project
A major component of the course will be a project, where you select a quantum algorithms paper/topic not covered in class 
and study it in greater detail.  Projects can be done individually or in groups of up to 3 people.  
[Here](https://github.com/troyjlee/qalgo/blob/main/PROJECT/project.pdf) are more details and some suggested 
project topics.
